Turns out tinkering with the config files of the network card when trying to set up a hotspot from the raspberry pi was a bad idea. I couldnt find out what i messed up so i had to do a full system restore. At least i had the foresight to create system restore points with timeshift, but this was a reminder to make snapshots more often. Wasted alot of time having to reinstall programs which should have been snapshotted. Long day, lesson learned.
### turn pi into wifi access point
### troubleshooting
Connected to mobile hotspot and it worked.
Did multiple attempts to create a hotspot through the normal wifi interfaces / commands on raspberry pi without success.
### first success
Installed RaspAP
